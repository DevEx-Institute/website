- DevEx refers to how developers experience building software or using dev tools.    
- It encompasses the emotions, frustrations, and productivity levels devs experience day to day. 
- DevEx is crucial for dev retention, productivity, and job satisfaction. 

## Why is Developer Experience important?

- Developers are in high demand and short supply. Offering a good DevEx helps attract and retain top talent. 
- Developers who enjoy their work and tools will be more productive and build higher quality software.   
- Good DevEx leads to more innovation as developers have the freedom to experiment.

## Developer Experience and productivity

- Developer productivity is tied closely to their experience using tools and workflows.
- Frustrating, inefficient tools and processes reduce productivity and job satisfaction.   
- Conversely, an enjoyable DevEx with intuitive tools leads to greater productivity and motivation. 

## What does a good Developer Experience look like?

- Fast, efficient tools and workflows that don't waste time
- Clear documentation and resources for learning new skills 
- An engaging community of other developers to collaborate with
